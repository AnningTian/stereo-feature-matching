# stereo-feature-matching

A real-time stereo camera feature matching demo using OpenCV.  
This project captures video from two cameras (or video files as fallback), applies keypoint detection and matching using **SIFT** and **ORB**, and displays visual results with performance metrics.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Dual camera (or dual video) input
- Support for **SIFT** and **ORB** keypoint detection
- Feature matching using **Brute-Force Matcher**
- Interactive mode switching via keyboard
- Matching metrics: match count, average distance, keypoint stats
- Real-time FPS display

---

## 🖥️ Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
python stereo_feature_matching.py
```

> If two cameras are not found, the program will automatically fall back to `1.mp4` and `2.mp4` from the working directory.

---

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action                |
|-----|------------------------|
| `s` | Toggle SIFT keypoints  |
| `m` | Toggle SIFT matching   |
| `o` | Toggle ORB keypoints   |
| `n` | Toggle ORB matching    |
| `q` | Quit                   |

> Only one mode is active at a time.

---

## 📊 On-Screen Display

- Matching Score (good matches / total keypoints)
- Average Match Distance
- Keypoints Count per frame
- Real-time FPS
